    "# Mini-Project: ARK minter\n",
    "\n",
    "For the next few weeks as you learn the basics of Django, I want you to build an ARK minter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please do a quick read through the [ARK documentation](https://confluence.ucop.edu/display/Curation/ARK) to familiarize yourself with the concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next , look at the [arkpy](https://github.com/mgiarlo/arkpy.git) package which you will import and use. It has a `mint()` function, that takes the Name Assigning Authority Number (NAAN), the ARK prefix, and the ARK template (pattern) and returns a randomly generated ARK.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could have just one Django Model for an ARK. However, some institutions may have multiple business units that want to mint ARKs. For instance, the main library and the law library are separate business units at most universities. So are the museums, and sometimes the institutional archive may be separate as well. So let's say that the system you are building will accomodate multiple Minters, each of which can produce their own ARKs. They will all fall under the same NAAN (Name Assigning Authority Number), but they can alter the \"shoulder\" and the \"key\" pattern that follows the NAAN in the ARK. Thus, you will have two models: an Ark model and a Minter model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1 - Project Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a Github project named `ark_service`, have it automatically create a Python `.gitignore` file for you\n",
    "- Clone your repository to your local machine\n",
    "- Create a virtual environment in it, named `ENV` and activate it with `source ENV/bin/activate`\n",
    "- Create a `requirements.txt` file, add `Django` and `arkpy`\n",
    "- Now run `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n",
    "- Create your Django project `django-admin startproject ark_service`\n",
    "\n",
    "We will assume that this system will be used by a single institution with one Name Assigning Authority Number (NAAN). Therefore, we should simply add that number to the sitewide settings instead of making it an attirbute of any Models. We don't have a real NAAN, so let's just say we have a NAAN of `12345`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add `NAAN = 12345` to the bottom of your `settings.py` file\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2 - Application Models\n",
    "\n",
    "- Now create a Django app `python manage.py startapp arkapp`\n",
    "- Add a Minter model and an Ark model with the following attributes and methods.\n",
    "- import arkpy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ark class**\n",
    "- Attributes\n",
    "  - **key** : a string field with max length 25, unique\n",
    "  - **date_created** : a date field, auto today\n",
    "  - **date_updated** : a date field, allow nulls and blanks\n",
    "  - **minter** : foreign key to Minter\n",
    "  - **url** : URL field, allow nulls and blanks\n",
    "- Methods\n",
    "  - **__repr__(self)** : override the default `__repr__` behavior to display `<Ark: key>`\n",
    "  - **bind(self, url)** : a method that adds or updates the target URL and changes the `date_updated`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Minter class** (This should actually come before the Ark class, since Arks have a Foreign Key pointing to it)\n",
    "- Attributes\n",
    "  - **name** : a string field\n",
    "  - **prefix** : a string field with max length 7\n",
    "  - **template** : a string field with max length 25\n",
    "  - **active** : a boolean field with default True\n",
    "  - **date_created** : a date field, auto today\n",
    "  - **description** : a string field\n",
    "- Methods\n",
    "  - **__repr__(self)** : override the default repr behavior to display `<Minter: name>`\n",
    "  - **_ark_exists(self, key)** : Use Ark.objects.filter(key=key) to search for the existence of an Ark and return True or False\n",
    "  - **mint(self, quantity)** : Use `self._ark_exists(self, key)` and `arkpy.mint(authority=settings.NAAN, prefix=self.prefix, template=self.template)` to mint as many Arks as requested. (Hint: for each Ark you should create loop that uses arkpy.mint() to randomly generate a key and then uses `self._ark_exists()` to check that you don't already have one with that key. If you don't, then use it; otherwise, loop back and generate another).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 3 - Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add a test suite for the Minter class in `tests.py`\n",
    "  - test the `_ark_exists()` method\n",
    "  - test the `mint()` method\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add a test suite for the Ark class in `tests.py`\n",
    "  - test the `bind()` method\n",
    "  \n",
    "- *Optional*\n",
    "  - create *fixture* data in a `fixtures` directory.\n",
    "  - This data can be loaded with the command `python manage.py loaddata arkapp`"

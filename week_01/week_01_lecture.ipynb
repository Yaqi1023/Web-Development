    "## Part 1. Virtual Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "In IS271, we discussed how to download and install 3rd party Python packages using **`pip`** (or `pip3`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- But what happens if you have one project that uses an older version of a package and then you start a new project using a new version of the same package?\n",
    "    - For example, you built a web app with Django 1.4 a few years ago, and now you want to buid another using Django 1.9.\n",
    "- If the new version of the package is not backwards compatible, your old project might crash!\n",
    "- So how do we ensure all our projects work even with different versions of the same package?\n",
    "    - We use something called ***Virtual Environments***!\n",
    "- Virtual Environments create a directory in your project where your 3rd party packages will be stored.\n",
    "- Since each project has its own package directory, there is no more concern about version conflicts and overwriting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how you create a virtual environment in Python3\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First you create the project directory and make it your working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "        mkdir myproject\n",
    "        cd myproject\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Next you create the virtual environment directory. The standard practice is to name it **`ENV`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "        pyvenv ENV\n",
    "        \n",
    "3. Whenever you work on that project you need to *activate* the virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "        source ENV/bin/activate\n",
    "        \n",
    "4. Notice that `(ENV)` is now a part of the shell prompt, signifying that it has been activated.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. You can now install the packages for your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "        (ENV) pip install pymarc\n",
    "        \n",
    "6. *Side note*: If you have several packages to install you can use a requirements file instead.\n",
    "    - Open a file named **`requirements.txt`**\n",
    "    - Put each package name on a new line.\n",
    "    - You can specify versions of packages as well. For example, Django v1.6 or higher, but not up to v1.9: `Django>=1.6,<1.9`\n",
    "    - Then use `pip` to install all of them at once using the **`-r`** flag.\n",
    "    \n",
    "            pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "            \n",
    "    - This is very useful when trying to run a project with several dependencies on a new machine.\n",
    "    \n",
    "7. Now try running Python and importing the packages you installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. To get out of the virtual environment, use **`deactivate`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "        (ENV) deactivate"
